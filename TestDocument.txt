#Test Document#

I ran several tests to make sure that this works.

To Test my ReadCount class I used three different files.

The first one only had 8 words in it and puncuation between each word.
This test resulted in the proper output.
The second and third documents were Hamlet and Sherlock Homes respectively. 

I compared my results with several other students who used the same file. 

We all had the same number of unique and total number of words.



In order to test the GUI class I had to do a number of different things.

To test the Drag and Drop feature, I tried to drag several different types of files on to the files. Only .txt files were accepted.

I also tried to drop more than one file into the field at once. I made sure that it only took the first file added.
