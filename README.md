#Summary#
This program will take in a text document and display the number of words and how many times each word is displayed in the text. This program will use a GUI to accomplish this. The user will be able to select which .txt file they want to have analyzed. The program will use a hash map to keep track of each word and it's frequency. This program will ignore punctuation and case.
